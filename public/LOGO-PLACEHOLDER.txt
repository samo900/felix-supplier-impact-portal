/* The Felix Project Logo Placeholder */
/* Replace public/felix-logo.png with actual logo */

PLACEHOLDER - Add The Felix Project logo as:
- public/felix-logo.png (192x192 or larger)

If you don't have the logo file yet, you can:
1. Extract it from https://agreeable-coast-093a0c203.3.azurestaticapps.net/
2. Or use an orange circle as placeholder

For now, the app will show a broken image icon until you add the logo file.
